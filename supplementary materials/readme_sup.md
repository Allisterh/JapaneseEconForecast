This folder contains some supplementary codes and their results that are not reported in the paper. Extra models includes sample mean and random walk (`baseline.r`), three- or four-variable VAR (`var.r`), Lasso with up to 12 lags (`lasso12.r`), 12-lag Lasso with smaller penalty for the lags of dependent variable (`lassoOwn.r`), 2-lag Lasso (`lasso2.r`) and 12-lag elastic net and group lasso (`ENET12.r` and `gLASSO12.r`, respectively). Please note that those codes are originally intended to be executed inside `execution.r`, therefore you may need to create appropriate placeholderes yourself. Results are saved as rds objects with names corresponds to reported models.  Results are very similar to those reported in the paper, four lags, which are generally better in terms of MSFE, albeit negligible.
